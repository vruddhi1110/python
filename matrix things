#If you don't want to initialize the elements to any specific value, you can do one of the following:

Option 1: Use None

result = [[None for _ in range(K)] for _ in range(N)]

Option 2: Use Empty Strings or Other Placeholders

If you'd like to use an empty placeholder (like an empty string), you can do this:


result = [["" for _ in range(K)] for _ in range(N)]

Option 3: Start with an Empty Matrix and Append Later

If you truly dresult = []  # Start with an empty matrix

# Append rows dynamically
for _ in range(N):
    result.append([])  # Add an empty row

# Example of adding elements dynamically
result[0].append(5)  # Add 5 to the first row
onâ€™t want to initialize anything right away,
you can start with an empty matrix and append rows or elements later:




// jo 0 thi intilize karwano hoy to ,


result = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(3)]
