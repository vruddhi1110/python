Read the Entire File

To read the entire content of a file as a single string:
# Open the file in read mode ('r')
with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()  # Reads the entire file content
    print(content)
Read Line by Line

with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # Strip removes trailing newline or spaces
Read All Lines into a List

To read all lines and store them in a list:

with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()  # Reads all lines into a list
    print(lines)

4. Read Specific Number of Characters

To read only a specific number of characters:

with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read(10)  # Reads the first 10 characters
    print(content)

5. Read a File Using open Without with

You can open a file without using the with statement,
but you must manually close the file afterward:

file = open("filename.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()  # Make sure to close the file to release resources
. Reading Binary Files

If you're working with binary files, such as images or videos


with open("filename.bin", "rb") as file:  # 'rb' means read binary
    binary_data = file.read()
    print(binary_data)
